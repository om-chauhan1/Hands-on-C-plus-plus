// Objects Memory Allocation in C++ :-
// The way memory is allocated to variables and functions of the class is different
// even though they both are from the same class.
// The memory is only allocated to the variables of the class when the object is created.
// The memory is not allocated to the variables when the class is declared.
// At the same time, single variables can have different values for different objects,
// so every object has an individual copy of all the variables of the class.
// But the memory is allocated to the function only once when the class is declared.
// So the objects donâ€™t have individual copies of functions only one copy is shared among each object.

// Arrays in Classes :-
// Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type.
// An array is very helpful when multiple variables are required, instead of making multiple variables
// one array can be used which can store multiple values. Array stores data in sequential order.
