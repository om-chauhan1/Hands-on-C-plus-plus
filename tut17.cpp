// Inline Functions in C++ :-
// Inline functions are used to reduce the function call.
// When one function is being called multiply times in the program it increases the
// execution time, so inline function is used to reduce time and increase program 
// efficiency. If the inline function is being used when the function is called, 
// the inline function expands the whole function code at the point of a function call,
// instead of running the function. Inline functions are considered to be used
// when the function is small otherwise it will not perform well.
// Inline is not recommended when static variables are being used in the function.

inline int product(int a, int b){
    // Not recommended to use below lines with inline functions
    // static c = 0; // This executes only once
    // c = c+1; // Next time this function is run, the value of c will be retained
    return a*b;
}

// Default Arguments in C++ :-
// Default arguments are those values which are used by the function if we donâ€™t input r
// our value. 
// It is recommended to write default arguments after the other arguments.
